# Mad Libs Game

This project is a fun and interactive Mad Libs game developed in Python. The program prompts the user to provide various inputs such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more. It then generates a hilarious story by filling in the blanks with the user-provided words.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files as a ZIP.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the `mad_libs.py` file using the following command:

   ```shell
   python mad_libs.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter different types of words when prompted (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

6. Once you have entered all the required words, the program will generate a funny story by replacing the blanks with the provided words.

7. Enjoy the hilarious and unique stories created by the Mad Libs game!

## Customizing the Game

You can easily customize the Mad Libs stories by modifying the `stories.py` file. Open the file in a text editor and update the existing stories or add your own. Make sure to keep the placeholders for different word types (e.g., [NOUN], [VERB], [ADJECTIVE]) intact, as they will be replaced with user inputs during the game.
